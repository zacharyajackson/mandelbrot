- üîç Smooth zoom functionality with double-click
- üé® Dynamic color palette generation
- üì± Fully responsive design
- ‚öôÔ∏è Collapsible control panel
- üîÑ View reset capability

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 Canvas
- Web Workers API
- Vite (Build tool)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mandelbrot-set.git
cd mandelbrot-set
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

npm run dev
```

## Usage

### Basic Navigation

- **Double-click**: Zoom in on any point
- **Reset Button**: Return to the initial view
- **Toggle Button**: Show/hide the control panel

### Example Interactions

1. Initial View
   - The complete Mandelbrot Set is visible
   - Black region represents the set
   - Colored regions show escape-time values

2. Zooming
   - Double-click on interesting boundary regions
   - Each zoom level provides more detail
   - Colors indicate iteration counts

## Development

### Project Structure

```
mandelbrot-set/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mandelbrot.js    # Main application logic
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worker.js        # Web Worker for calculations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html           # Entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json         # Project configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Documentation
```

### Key Components

- **Main Thread (`mandelbrot.js`)**
  - Handles UI interactions
  - Manages the canvas
  - Coordinates with Web Worker

- **Web Worker (`worker.js`)**
  - Performs Mandelbrot Set calculations
  - Handles complex number operations
  - Returns iteration results

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Testing

Currently, the project relies on manual testing. Key test cases:

1. Viewport Resizing
2. Zoom Functionality
3. Color Rendering
4. Worker Communication
5. Control Panel Operation

## Deployment

1. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy the `dist` directory to your preferred hosting service.

3. For Netlify:
   - Connect your repository
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `dist`

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Contribution Guidelines
